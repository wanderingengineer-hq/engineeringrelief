    Where to even begin... I truly don't remember a period of time in my life where everything was so overwhelming and so hectic at the same time. All the uncertainties, all the rush, all the panic, the entire mess of settling into the dorm room... Needless to say, my first day in Poland was nothing short of a chaos itself. At the end of the first day, I was so overwhelmed with a whirlwind of emotions and physical fatigue thst I ended up crying a bit in the dorm room. But! Surprisingly the next day, things already started to settle down piece by piece. After handling some bank stuff, I strolled back to my dorm room listening to some of my favorite artists, and all of it started to feel more and more managable.

    After the first 5 days without any classes or school related events, We've eventually had our first meeting with the faculty coordinator and learned about basically what we will be doing for the remainder of the term. Thankfully, our schedule wasn't packed and our professors were really understanding about how this was an opportunity for us to travel and visit places during our stay in Poland. During our classes the first week, we basically just met the professors and the overall curriculum for each class. It was more like an orientation event for all of us rather than actual lectures, which was really helpful at the end of the day.

    Onto my highlight of these 2 weeks. On thursday, on 8th of October, the Exchange Student Office here in my university had organized a welcome gala for all the international students. Attending that event was the best choice I've ever made thus far. I got to meet so many new people from all over the world! It was honestly so enjoyable. It was so enjoyable that I basically travel and hang out with those people. I have a bit of a disadvantage because of my location (since it's not near the main campus), but that doesn't stop me at all. I make sure to be as social and as active as possible, regardless of the distances I have to go through occasionally.

    As expected (at least of myself hahaha), I've spent a good portion of the first two weeks just settling in and basically taking the fundamental steps to make my dormitory and overall this place a liveable space, be it by handling financial troubles or hygienic stuff for the dorm itself. I still have so much to do on my mind. So many places, cities, countries to visit... Even thinking about it excites me and equally terrifies me lol. But! I genuinely can't wait to collect so many memories with the people I've met here. Stay tuned for the travel updates and more personal entries!
